In the bin directory you can find the binary releases compiled in/for Ubuntu, but they should work with other distros.

In the src directory there are the source tar balls. To compile, just unpack, run './configure' and 'make'.

Documentation about the configuration can be found in the project web at http://rclauncher.sourceforge.net/
